      <h1>Can you introduce yourself?</h1>
      <p>
        _"Hello, Iâ€™m Atik-Al-Mahmud, a Computer Science graduate from Stamford
        University of Bangladesh. I am passionate about front-end development
        and have hands-on experience with React, Next.js, JavaScript, HTML, and
        CSS. I have worked on projects like an Amazon-like e-commerce platform
        and a food ordering app, where I focused on UI optimization,
        responsiveness, and improving user experience. I am always eager to
        learn new technologies and improve my problem-solving skills. This
        opportunity excites me because I believe my skills and enthusiasm will
        add value to your development team while helping me grow as a

      <h1>What is the difference between React and Next.js?</h1>
      <p>
        React is a JavaScript library used for building dynamic UI components in
        single-page applications (SPA). Next.js is a React framework that
        provides additional features like server-side rendering (SSR), static
        site generation (SSG), and API routes, making applications faster and
        more SEO-friendly.
      </p>
      <h1>How do you optimize the performance of a React application?</h1>
      <p>
        Lazy Loading: Load components dynamically using React.lazy() and
        Suspense. React.memo(): Prevents unnecessary re-renders of functional
        components. Code Splitting: Use dynamic imports to reduce the initial
        bundle size. Efficient State Management: Use Redux or Context API to
        manage the global state efficiently. Debouncing & Throttling: Optimize
        event handlers for better performance. Optimized Images: Use Next.js
        Image component for automatic image optimization.
      </p>
      <h1>What is the difference between useState and useEffect in React?</h1>
      <p>
        useState: A React Hook used to manage state inside a functional
        component. useEffect: A Hook that handles side effects like fetching
        data, subscribing to events, or updating the DOM.

      <h1>Tell me about a challenging project you worked on.</h1>
      <p>
        "One of my challenging projects was building an Amazon-like e-commerce
        website. Initially, the website had slow load times and UI
        responsiveness issues. To solve this: I optimized the images by using
        lazy loading. I used React.memo() to prevent unnecessary re-renders. I
        implemented Redux for efficient state management. After these
        optimizations, the websiteâ€™s performance improved by 20%, leading to a
        smoother user experience."
      </p>
      <h1>How do you handle pressure and tight deadlines?</h1>
      <p>
        "I stay calm under pressure by prioritizing tasks and managing my time
        efficiently. I use tools like Trello and Notion to keep track of my
        tasks and break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.
        Additionally, if I face difficulties, I communicate proactively with my
        team to find solutions, ensuring that deadlines are met without
        compromising quality."
