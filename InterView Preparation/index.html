      <h1>Can you introduce yourself?</h1>
      <p>
        _"Hello, Iâ€™m Atik-Al-Mahmud, a final-year Computer Science student at
        Stamford University of Bangladesh. I am passionate about front-end
        development and have hands-on experience with React, Next.js,
        JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I have worked on projects like an Amazon-like
        e-commerce platform and a food ordering app, where I focused on UI
        optimization, responsiveness, and improving user experience. I am always
        eager to learn new technologies and improve my problem-solving skills.
        This opportunity excites me because I believe my skills and enthusiasm
        will add value to your development team while helping me grow as a
        developer."_

      <h1>What is the difference between React and Next.js?</h1>
      <p>
        React is a JavaScript library used for building dynamic UI components in
        single-page applications (SPA). Next.js is a React framework that
        provides additional features like server-side rendering (SSR), static
        site generation (SSG), and API routes, making applications faster and
        more SEO-friendly.
      </p>
      <h1>How do you optimize the performance of a React application?</h1>
      <p>
        Lazy Loading: Load components dynamically using React.lazy() and
        Suspense. React.memo(): Prevents unnecessary re-renders of functional
        components. Code Splitting: Use dynamic imports to reduce the initial
        bundle size. Efficient State Management: Use Redux or Context API to
        manage the global state efficiently. Debouncing & Throttling: Optimize
        event handlers for better performance. Optimized Images: Use Next.js
        Image component for automatic image optimization.
      </p>
      <h1>What is the difference between useState and useEffect in React?</h1>
      <p>
        useState: A React Hook used to manage state inside a functional
        component. useEffect: A Hook that handles side effects like fetching
        data, subscribing to events, or updating the DOM.
